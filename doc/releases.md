# 2.0

We have change the internal parameterization of curves to adhere to common industry standards, and to allow for more flexibility in the future. This change is not backwards compatible, and will require some changes to your code. We have also added a new `BoundedCurve` class that is the base class for curves that have a fixed domain.
For more details see the (release documentation)[https://github.com/hypar-io/Elements/blob/master/releases/elements.2.0.md] in the elements repository.
